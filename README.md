# mbt-customize

MantisBT Plugin to put back what the "Modern UI" build broke.

Bringing back the ability to use the following `config.php` settings:
```php
$g_top_include_page = '%absolute_path%/config/top.php';
$g_bottom_include_page = '%absolute_path%/config/bottom.php';
$g_meta_include_file = '%absolute_path%/config/meta.php';
```
